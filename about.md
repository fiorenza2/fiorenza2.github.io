# About Me

</p>

I'm a DPhil/PhD student supervised by Profs. [Steve Roberts](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~sjrob/) and [Mike Osbourne](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~mosb/) in the [Machine Learning Research Group](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~parg/) at the University of Oxford working in Bayesian machine learning. Previously I was an [AI Resident](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/microsoft-ai-residency-program/) at [Microsoft Research Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/) where I worked on Deep RL for video games and automatic knowledge base creation. I have Masters Degrees in [Machine Learning](http://www.mlsalt.eng.cam.ac.uk/) and [Engineering Science](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/courses-listing/engineering-science) from the Universities of [Cambridge](https://cam.ac.uk) and [Oxford](https://ox.ac.uk) respectively. In a previous life, I was a Management Consultant/Data Scientist at [Accenture](https://accenture.com).

I did my masters thesis ([Fairness in Machine Learning with Causal Reasoning](/pdfs/thesis.pdf)) under [Dr. Adrian Weller](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/programme-directors/adrian-weller) in algorithmic fairness. It concerned the application of sensitivity analysis methods in the causal literature to counterfactual fairness, and learning counterfactually fair representations using variational and adversarial methods.

In my spare time I like to play the bass guitar and read. I can also speak Mandarin to a relatively fluent level, which has led me to work for extended periods of time in China and Hong Kong.
