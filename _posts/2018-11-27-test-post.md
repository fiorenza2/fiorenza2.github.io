So here is some $\LaTeX$ code.

$$
\begin{equation}
y = mx + c
\label{eq:line}
\end{equation}
$$

$$
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}[x] = \mu_x
\end{equation}
$$

Let's reference Equation \eqref{eq:line}.

Remember to always wrap $\LaTeX$ stuff with the dollar signs, especially the ``begin{...} end{...}`` stuff.
